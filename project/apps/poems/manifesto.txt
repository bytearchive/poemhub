elephant:  Poetry publication is broken.

Journals are self-referential circle jerk bullshit. By poets, for poets.  You can tell how bad things are when they're giving away subscriptions if you submit their work, and it underlies an ugly truth: <i>the only people subscribing to most journals are poets looking to be published.</i>  That's absurd. Imagine a music concert, where only musicians who wanted to get onstage showed up, or a movie theater filled only with actors, waiting for the studio address in the credits.  That's not a living, vibrant art, that's a death spiral.

Poetry isn't the problem.  *Access* to poetry is the problem.  The fact that the general public's access to poetry is limited by cost and editorial choices that make no sense 

The general public can only see poetry that a) some Big Poet/Editor Somewhere said was worth seeing and b) they're willing to pay for.  That's ridiculous.

Manifesto, (for writers), too:
I'm pretty sure you don't write poetry so you can sit and send submissions to journals, hoping you don't get a ding letter back. I'm pretty sure you write poetry to connect with people.  To get your ideas and visions and emotions and world out of your head and interacting with another human, somewhere.  Me too.  So let's cut out the middle-man.

poemhub aims to be the best place to revise, edit, publish, and share your poetry.  We don't keep your copyrights or have silly publication limitations.  They're your words.  Take them wherever you'd like.

We also aim to connect you to your readers in way traditional journals never have, telling you how many people have <i>actually read</i> your work, and allowing you to engage with readers, on your terms.

poemhub is about giving poetry back to the two groups should have had it all along: poets, and readers.



For writers:

We aim to be the best place to revise, edit, and publish your poetry.  poemhub keeps revisions of all your changes, automatically, and lets you easily look back.  It also lets you share those revisions with your audience, if you choose.

It gives you one-click publishing that looks <i>fantastic</i>, and automatic analytics on which pieces are most popular. 

And, for premium members, it gives you helpful goodies, like monthly emailed backups of all your writing (no more only-copy worry), custom URLs, and more.




For readers:

We aim to be the best place for you to find and read poetry.  From new work from the most current poets to a steady stream of the classics, we present each poem to stand on its own, and for you to enjoy.  Poemr also gives you a direct line to many authors, to give those "Wow, this line makes all the hairs on the back of my neck stand up" comments you've always wanted to give.

Readers can also (soon!) subscribe to have a selection of poems delivered to their inbox once a week.


Thanks for using poemhub.

The poemhub Manifesto

It's time to acknowledge the elephant in the room: 99% of all poetry journals are bullshit.

It's true. 99% of them are a circle-jerk of frou-frou writing that your mom wouldn't understand, and they're run by the same folks that convince writers they need an MBA to be a poet.  You don't.

To be a poet, you need to:
a) write a poem, and
b) put it into the world.

The End.

poemhub is a free-for-all of poetry.  It pulls the decisions of what makes "good poetry" out of (largely old, white, male) editorial committees, and back where they belong - with readers.

To be fair, poetry journals once were necessary, and did a lot of good.  Books were once the only practical way to distribute poems, and since they cost money to make and ship, you simply couldn't print everything.  Thus was born editors, journals, and ding letters.

But with the advent of the internet, things have changed.  Distribution is nearly free (poemhub runs on voluntary premium memberships that are just five bucks a year.) Authors and readers can now be connected directly. 
Justifying the continuation of bullshit poetry journals in the face of these benefits is like arguing that all writing is better when transcribed by hand, in the face of printing presses.  You can do it, and many journals will, but in the end, better economics and better access will win.

In the long view, there will be lots of sites and apps like poemhub.  Some of them will even be better. That's as it should be.  The big thing is that poetry belongs to all of us, and it's time we got it back.

It's 2014.  poetry, welcome to the internet.






there's this fucked up thing that happens - on some level, some people publish in obscure journals because they're _embarrassed_ of their writing.  they publish there because they don't *want* anyone they know to read it. That's fucked up, and we're sorry, miss talented writer, we're not letting you hide in your dark hole of obscurity anymore.
