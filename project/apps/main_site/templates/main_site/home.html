            <h2>Your words.  A global audience.</h2>
            <p>If you're like us, you write poetry to connect with people.  To get the ideas and visions and emotions and world out of your head and interacting with another human, somewhere.  We built Poemhub to directly connect poems and readers. The poets published here agree &ndash; it works.

            <h2>The best revision tool for poetry.</h2>
            <p>Poemhub was built by poets.  We built it to be the best place to keep all our drafts, with everything we wanted, and nothing we didn't.  It automatically saves all your revisions, and lets you look back. It has a simple, uncluttered interface that is <i>exactly</i> the way your poem will look published.  Even better, Poemhub it lets you keep publishing revisions, even after you've published your poem.</p>

            
            <h2>Safe. You keep the rights. Download everything, anytime.</h2>
            
            <p>As poets, the last thing we wanted was a service that kept the work hostage.  Poemhub doesn't keep your copyrights or have silly where-else-was-this-published limitations.  They're your words.  Take them wherever you'd like. We also provide a one-click backup to download everything you have on Poemhub - published poems, drafts, even the list of things you've read and liked.</p>

            <h2>Connect with your readers.</h2>
            
            <p>We create direct, novel interactions between you and your readers, <i>on your terms</i>.  When you publish on Poemhub, you can finally know how many people have <i>actually read</i> each of your poems, and which are the most beloved.  We also give you the option to connect with to your readers in ways traditional journals can't - by having discussions and commentary right with your poems.</p>

            <p>To top it off, Poemhub is free to use.</p>
